# Chat-Based Java Application using OCSF Framework
Welcome to the chat-based Java application using the Object Client-Server Framework (OCSF)! 
This project allows you to create a client-server chat application where clients can communicate 
with each other through a central server using the OCSF framework in Java.

## Features
#### OCSF Framework: 
The application utilizes the Object Client-Server Framework (OCSF), which provides 
a higher-level abstraction for building client-server applications.

#### Multithreading: 
The OCSF framework handles multithreading automatically, allowing concurrent 
communication with multiple clients.

#### Text-Based Interface: 
The application still provides a text-based interface for sending and receiving 
messages, similar to the previous version.
